We have a backend system that store some vehicles with two types (car , plane) . we need to store the brand of each vehicle into the database.  You will take the database properties details (url , username , password) and store them into a properties file.
Define a new implementation for the Vehicle interface that contains a method for save data into database
Define Car Class and Plane class from Vehicle
Define a application.properties file that contains these values
database.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
database.username = ahmed
database.password = MyPassWord123
Define a class that will make the database operations
Use a DatabaseOperation object inside car class and plane class to store their data into the database
Reference your new implementation in the Spring config file (applicationContext.xml).
Apply the Constructor injection into Car bean
Apply the Setter injection into Plane bean
Retrieve a bean for Car class and store the data into the database
Retrieve a bean for Plane class and store the data into the database
